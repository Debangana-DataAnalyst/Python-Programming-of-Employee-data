Project summary: 
<br>
Employee data processing and analysis 
<br>
Project overview:
<br>
The task involved processing emoloyee data from various files in different formats, focusing on JSON data to eventually migrate to SQL database and perform additional data analysis.
<br>
Steps:
<br>
Printed number of files with the term "employee" in the file name
<br>
Identified and opened the json file
<br>

<br>
Stored column names in a seperate list
<br>
created sqlite database 'data.db' and a table called as "employee" within the data.db.
<br>
Populated the data received from json into a nested list, and putted this across into the employee table.
<br>
Imported the SQL data into a Pandas DataFrame.
<br>
Added a bonus of 15%  to all the vaccinated employees and 5% to the non-vaccinated employees,column named "Bonus percent".
<br>
Exported the final DataFrame to an Excel file named 'employee.xlsx'
<br>
Input file:
<br>
employee.json 
Output file:
<br>
data.db
employee.xlsx
<br>
Considerations ensured:
<br>
Overall efficiency of the code 
Appropriate object names
